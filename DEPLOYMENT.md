# Deployment Guide for Meow Meow Pet Shop

## Password Reset Configuration

### Current Situation
The password reset feature is currently experiencing issues in the Replit development environment due to localhost URL conflicts. However, **this will work perfectly when deployed to your own domain**.

### How It Works
1. **Development Environment**: The system tries to detect the Replit domain automatically, but this can be unreliable due to how Replit handles internal vs external URLs.

2. **Production Environment**: When deployed to your own domain (e.g., `https://yourpetshop.com`), the password reset will work flawlessly because:
   - The system uses `window.location.origin` which will be your actual domain
   - Supabase will send emails with links pointing to your domain
   - No localhost/development URL conflicts

### Deployment Steps
1. **Set up your domain** (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or your hosting provider)
2. **Configure Supabase** in production:
   - Update your Supabase project settings
   - Add your production domain to the allowed redirect URLs
   - Set the environment variables on your hosting platform
3. **Deploy the application** to your domain
4. **Test the password reset** - it will work correctly

### Environment Variables Needed for Production
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
```

### Supabase Configuration for Production
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication > URL Configuration
3. Add your production domain to "Redirect URLs"
4. The password reset will automatically use your domain

### Why It Will Work on Your Domain
- No localhost conflicts
- Proper HTTPS URLs
- Standard web hosting environment
- Supabase designed for production domains

The password reset feature is fully implemented and ready for production deployment.
