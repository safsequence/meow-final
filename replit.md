## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend components:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Design**: RESTful API structure
- **Development**: Hot module replacement with Vite integration

### Database Architecture
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **Schema**: Centralized schema definition in shared directory
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database migrations

## Key Components

### Directory Structure
```
├── client/          # Frontend React application
├── server/          # Backend Express server
├── shared/          # Shared types and schemas
├── attached_assets/ # Static assets and images
└── migrations/      # Database migration files
```

### Frontend Components
- **Layout Components**: Header with top strip, main navigation, sidebar, and footer
- **Section Components**: Hero banner, product listings, categories, testimonials
- **UI Components**: Reusable components built on shadcn/ui
- **Custom Components**: Product cards, countdown timers, carousels

### Backend Components
- **Routes**: RESTful API endpoints for categories, brands, products, blog posts
- **Storage Layer**: Abstract storage interface with in-memory implementation
- **Server Setup**: Express middleware configuration and error handling

### Shared Components
- **Schema**: Drizzle schema definitions for all database tables
- **Types**: TypeScript type definitions exported from schema

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components use TanStack Query to fetch data
2. **API Layer**: Express routes handle HTTP requests and validate input
3. **Storage Layer**: Abstract storage interface processes business logic
4. **Database**: Drizzle ORM executes type-safe database queries
5. **Response**: JSON data flows back through the same layers

The application uses a query-first approach where the frontend drives data requirements, and the backend provides a clean API interface.

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **UI Framework**: React ecosystem with hooks and modern patterns
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS processing
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date manipulation

### Backend Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store

### Development Dependencies
- **Build Tools**: Vite with React plugin
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support across the stack
- **Development**: Hot reload and error overlay for development experience

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite compiles React app to static assets in `dist/public`
2. **Backend Build**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations ensure schema consistency

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Uses Vite dev server with Express API proxy
- **Production**: Serves static files from Express with API routes
- **Database**: Environment variable `DATABASE_URL` for connection

### Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Development mode with hot reload
- `npm run build`: Production build for both frontend and backend
- `npm start`: Production server startup
- `npm run db:push`: Database schema synchronization

The application is designed for easy deployment to platforms like Replit, Vercel, or traditional hosting providers with Node.js support.
